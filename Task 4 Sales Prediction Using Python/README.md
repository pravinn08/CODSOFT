Task 4: Sales Prediction Objective: Predict product sales based on advertising spend (TV, Radio, Newspaper). Dataset: Advertising dataset (200 samples, 4 features)

Approach

Features: TV, Radio, Newspaper advertising spend ($K)
Model: Linear Regression
Evaluation: R² score, Mean Squared Error
Key Insights

Radio > TV > Newspaper impact on sales
Strong linear relationship (R² > 0.90)
Code Structure 1.Load advertising dataset 2.EDA + correlation analysis 3.Train/test split (80/20) 4.Linear Regression training 5.Model evaluation + feature importance 6.Predict sales for new ad budget

Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
